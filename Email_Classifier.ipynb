In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",

Recall is 0 as no emails are flagged as spam using zero predictor. We observe these values to understand if our classifier is useful for predicting future data.

    "1. Consider the correlation between multiple features (look up correlation plots and `sns.heatmap`). \n",

    "### Question 9: ROC Curve\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases we won't be able to get no false positives and no false negatives, so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that logistic regression calculates the probability that an example belongs to a certain class. Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC curve shows this trade off for each possible cutoff probability. In the cell below, plot an ROC curve for your final classifier (the one you use to make predictions for Kaggle). Refer to the Lecture 22 notebook or Section 17.7 of the course text to see how to plot an ROC curve.\n",
